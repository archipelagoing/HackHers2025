## Flirtify: Match Through Music ðŸŽµ
## Inspiration
Music has always been a powerful connector of people. We realized that someone's music taste can tell you a lot about their personality, emotions, and potential compatibility. Flirtify was born from the idea that shared musical interests could be the foundation for meaningful connections.

## What it does
Flirtify is a sophisticated music-based matching platform that:
- Analyzes users' Spotify listening habits
- Compares musical preferences using advanced algorithms
- Generates compatibility scores based on:
    -Shared favorite artists (30%) Common tracks (20%) Genre overlap (15%) Music characteristic similarity (35%)
Provides detailed match insights with specific shared interests
Stores match history for future reference

## How we built it
Tech Stack:

Frontend: (Planned)
- React
- TailwindCSS
- Spotify Web Playback SDK

Backend:
- FastAPI (Python)
- Firebase/Firestore
- Spotify API
- NumPy & Scikit-learn
